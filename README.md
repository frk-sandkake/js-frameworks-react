# JS-Frameworks-React

These examples are related to React JS and each folder is structured with the naming convention of "day-1-start" and "day-1-end", for instance. The "start" folder represents the beginning point for our collaboration, while the "end" folder depicts the final outcome of what we'll be coding together during the class.

### running

Make sure you have node , npm installed on your machine

`cd` in your terminal to the desired folder for example : `cd day-1-end` and then run `npm install` then `npm run build` to build the project and `npm run  start` to run the project.
