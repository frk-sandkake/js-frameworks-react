# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Teaching Parts

# 1. Show the end Result Project ‚úÖ
# 2. Explain The App.js and how it works : The index.js is the entry point for the
# whole app it goes and finds an element with an id of root `document.getElementById('root')`
# and attach the App.js. ‚úÖ
# 3. the element with id ``root`` is in public folder in the ``index.html`` ‚úÖ
# 4. Show how to add google fonts to react JS CRA project. Use the index.html  ‚úÖ
# 5. Reminds that the CSS will be loaded before anything else , before even the JS gets loaded.  ‚úÖ
# 6. Get rid of the initial styles on the project in the index.css  ‚úÖ
# 7. use the new font-family we get from Google Fronts on the body tag
# 8. Explain the App.js Functional component and how it works  ‚úÖ
# 9. Explain why we use className to have classes and not class ( We use className because it is a reserved word in JS ) 
# The code in the App.js looks like it is ``HTML`` but it not, it is JSX ( It is a mixer of JavaScript and HTML ) ‚úÖ
# 10. Show how the logo is being imported and used.
# 11. Start to code,  Delete everything in the App.js and start coding.
# 12. Start at the App.js add class container
# 13. Write some CSS for the Class container
# 14. Explain what is a components and how the ``App.js`` is working at this point
# 15. show how it is being export it and used in the ``index.js`` file
# 16. Start by dividing the ``App.js`` component to smaller components.
# 17. create a folder components to put our new baby üë∂ üçº components in.
# 18. Create the ```PageHeading.js``` and notice here the component name is Capitalized but the folder for the components is lowercase ( Very good practice please follow)
# 19. Write a Heading functional component and export it
# 20. use the Heading component in the App.js and delete the old heading title we had.
# 21. Create a Paragraph Component
# 22. Create a List Component
# 23. In the List Component add an extra Item and you will notice that the DOM is updated
